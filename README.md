3. run the demo application `lein run /path/to/word/list.txt`

## API - packages

### erdos.suffixtrie

This package contains a suffix trie agorithm. Construction is O(N^2) time, space is O(N^2) time.

`(->trie "word1" "word2" ...)` Create a suffix trie object.

`(suffix-of trie "abc")` Returns a lazy list of words having the suffix "abc"

`(find-words trie "abc")` Returns a lazy list of words that contain "abc".

### erdos.suffixtree

Suffix tree algorithm. Construction is based on Ukkonen's algorithm, thus providing a very fast O(N) construction time and requires O(N) space.

`(->tree "long text")` Creates a suffix tree object for a single long text. 

`(index-of triee "substring")` Returns the integer index of a substring in a tree, or nil when not found.
